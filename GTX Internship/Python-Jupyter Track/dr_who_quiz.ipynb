Remember, the keys of the `question_bank` dictionary need to be the questions, and the values need to be possible answers (options). The keys of the `answer_bank` need to be characters or objects (e.g., 'Cat' and 'Dog'), and the values need to be lists of traits that describe their respective characters, e.g. ['NAPS', 'BALLS OF YARN'] for Cat, and ['WALKS', 'TENNIS BALLS'] for Dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three things to keep in mind:\n",
    "1. The number of questions should remain odd. Otherwise, you'll have to figure out what to do if there is a tie!\n",
    "2. The values in `answer_bank` need to be **unique** to the key they belong to.\n",
    "3. Format your list of values in `answer_bank` to be uppercase,\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a personality quiz based on two personalities. When there are three, or four, or five, or more, the scoring becomes more complicated since ties are more likely and the `match` variable will need to be modified.\n",
